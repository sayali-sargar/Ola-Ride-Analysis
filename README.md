## Dataset Description

The dataset contains Ola ride booking data collected over a defined time period.  
It includes information such as booking status, vehicle type, pickup and drop locations, ride distance, booking value, payment method, and customer and driver ratings.  
The dataset contains over **100,000 ride booking records**, making it suitable for analyzing large-scale booking behavior and operational trends.

## SQL Analysis Overview

SQL was used to analyze the Ola ride booking data and answer key business questions.  
The analysis focused on metrics that directly impact business outcomes, such as booking success rates, cancellation behavior, revenue contribution, ride distance patterns, and customer and driver ratings.  
The results from SQL analysis were then used to design meaningful visualizations in Power BI.

## Power BI Dashboard Overview

Power BI was used to create an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights from the Ola ride booking data.  
The dashboard highlights booking trends, cancellation patterns, revenue distribution, ride distance analysis, and customer and driver ratings.  
These visualizations help in understanding overall performance, identifying operational gaps, and supporting data-driven decision-making.

## Project Summary

- Analyzed **103,024 Ola ride bookings** using SQL and Power BI to understand booking performance, cancellations, revenue patterns, and user behavior  
- Achieved a **~62.1% booking success rate**, with **~28.1% cancellations** and **~9.8% driver-not-found cases**, indicating strong demand but operational gaps  
- Generated a total booking value of approximately **₹35 million**, with revenue contribution balanced across multiple vehicle categories  
- Identified that **Cash (₹19.3M) and UPI (₹14.2M)** together contributed **~96% of total revenue**, highlighting dominant payment preferences  
- Observed **stable customer and driver ratings (~4.0)** across vehicle types, suggesting that cancellations are primarily operational rather than service-quality driven
