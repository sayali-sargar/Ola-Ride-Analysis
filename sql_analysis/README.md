# SQL Analysis Approach

In this project, SQL was used as the primary tool to analyze Ola ride booking data and answer key analytical and business questions.

## How I approached the analysis

I started by understanding the structure and quality of the data.  
Basic checks were performed to review booking statuses, cancellations, and incomplete rides to get a clear picture of the dataset.

After gaining confidence in the data, I explored important metrics such as ride distance, vehicle types, and customer and driver ratings to identify patterns and variations.

Finally, I focused on business-oriented queries to understand revenue contribution, high-frequency customers, and operational issues such as driver-side cancellations.

## Query design choices

- Views were used to keep queries readable and reusable  
- Queries were written in a structured manner to reflect data understanding, exploration, and business insights  
- The analysis focused on clarity and correctness rather than over-complex SQL techniques  

## Outcome

The SQL analysis provided a strong foundation for identifying trends and insights, which were later visualized using Power BI dashboards.
