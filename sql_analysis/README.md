# SQL Analysis Approach

In this project, SQL was used as the primary tool to analyze Ola ride booking data and answer key analytical and business-focused questions.

## How I approached the analysis

I began by understanding the structure, and quality of the dataset.  
Initial checks were performed to validate booking statuses, cancellations, and incomplete rides to ensure data accuracy and consistency before deeper analysis.

After establishing confidence in the data, I explored core metrics such as ride distance, vehicle types, and customer and driver ratings to identify usage patterns and variations across categories.

Finally, I focused on business-oriented queries that directly impact decision-making, including revenue contribution, cancellation drivers, and high-frequency usage patterns.

## Query design choices

- Views were used to keep queries readable, reusable, and logically organized  
- Queries were structured to reflect stages of data understanding, exploration, and business insight generation  
- The analysis prioritized clarity, correctness, and business relevance over overly complex SQL techniques  

## Outcome

The SQL analysis ensured reliable insights and a strong analytical foundation, which were later translated into Power BI visualizations for effective communication with stakeholders.
